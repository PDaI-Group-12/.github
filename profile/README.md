Our project is an Employee and Employer app for reporting and monitoring working hours and wages.  

Roles: employee, employer, and administrator. Admin could be employer, to be defined. 

The app has a frontpage with links to register and login pages. After login employee can see a main page where you can choose active period reporting for adding working hours, implemented tasks, and seeing coming wages. On history page exists for checking your previous periods with work hours and wage. Employer can check and approve the working hours of all employees.  

Tasks: 
- Drafts of user interfaces and workflows 
- High level system architecture 
- Database structure  
- Continuously update and maintain of this text  

A proposal: contract salary (urakkapalkka) is out of scope in this project. 

Architecture. The coding language is typescript, middleware nodejs(?) and database is PostgreSQL. All architecture components must be defined together. The app will be published in Render or OAMK server?
